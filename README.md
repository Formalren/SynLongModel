This project includes multiple NSHA models, including lifting coil model, transfer coil model, risk model, controller model, and these NSHA models constitute the NRCPS system. These models is showed in the NRCPS.XML. You can run this xml file in UPPAAL-5.0 tool. 


In addition to the NSHA model of NRCPS, we also performed accessibility analysis on these models and displayed them in the symbolic simulator. 
For different risk levels, by traversing the state space of the model, we analyze whether there is a state transition path that can cause the nuclear reactor system to enter a dangerous event.
